# 📊 ML & Data Analysis: PM2.5 and Health Dataset for STEM Education

## 🧠 Overview

This project provides a practical, beginner-friendly example of how to apply machine learning and data analysis using Google Colab and Python in the context of real-world STEM learning. It is specially designed for **secondary school teachers and students**.

The project uses a simulated dataset on **PM2.5 air quality and related health symptoms**, demonstrating how data can be used to explore relationships and build simple predictive models.
